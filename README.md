## Description/Objective/Goals 
Our Tasks were as follows:

2. Once we decided on several API's that we were comfortable with using we shaped our website idea around how we could best impliment two of them.
3. We then drew a mock up of our web page using google presentation.
4. Next we worked on the HTML/index and CSS files.
5. Once the basic structure of the index page was set up,
6. We then began to work on our JavaScript page.
7. Our next step was clearing up some functionality issues and debugging our page.
